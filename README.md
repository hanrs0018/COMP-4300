# COMP-4300

Computer Architecture

Lab 1

Write a VHDL program consisting of a single entity whose architecture is a single process that implements an XORgate. That is, a circuit which behaves as specified in the following truth table. You should implement your architecture as a single process. 

Lab 2

This lab develops the first building block for the MIPS datapath, the ALU. It will be combined with the other data path components from later labs, resulting in a complete MIPS by Lab 4.


Lab 3

This lab develops the remaining datapath building blocks for the MIPS datapath. It will be combined with the MIPScontrol logic to make a working cpu in Lab 4.
